**THIS IS NOT A REPORTING TASK - THIS IS A FIXING TASK!**

# âœ… /check ARGUMENTS$

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PARALLEL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**
This command MUST spawn ALL agents IN PARALLEL using single messages with multiple Task tool invocations.
NEVER spawn agents sequentially - this defeats the purpose of comprehensive quality verification.

## Arguments Integration

**Task**: ARGUMENTS$

Apply to: store_daddy: Store specific files/areas to check and quality requirements

**For any tasks created during issue fixing, use scope: 'maintenance'**

---

## Quality Verification & Fixing

**CRITICAL: Use PARALLEL spawning - ALL agents in ONE message:**
```
"I found issues across the codebase. Spawning multiple agents IN PARALLEL to fix all these issues:
- typegod: Fix TypeScript/config/dependency issues in [config files with issues]
- debuggy: Fix test failures and runtime errors in files A, B, C
- nextking: Fix Next.js/React issues in components D, E, F
- debuggy (additional): Fix remaining build/type errors in files G, H, I

Spawning all agents simultaneously now..."
[Use single message with multiple Task tool invocations]
```

## Comprehensive Validation

**CRITICAL: Spawn ALL validation agents IN PARALLEL - single message, multiple tools:**
```
"Spawning agents IN PARALLEL to validate everything is working:
- nextking: Run all tests and fix any failures (Next.js/React specialist)
- typegod: Validate all configurations and TypeScript setup
- debuggy: Check for runtime errors and edge cases
- nextking: Verify build processes and deployments work

Spawning all validation agents simultaneously now..."
[MUST use single message with multiple Task tool invocations]
```

**CRITICAL: Use Specialized Language Agents Based on Tech Stack:**
- **Go projects** â†’ use **gopher** agent for all Go-related coding tasks
- **JavaScript/Node.js** â†’ use **jsmaster** agent for all JavaScript/Node.js tasks
- **Python projects** â†’ use **thesnake** agent for all Python development tasks
- **TypeScript projects** â†’ use **typegod** agent for all TypeScript tasks
- **React projects** â†’ use **reactlord** agent for all React component/hook tasks
- **Vue.js projects** â†’ use **vuelord** agent for all Vue.js development tasks
- **Next.js projects** â†’ use **nextking** agent for all Next.js application tasks
- **Mixed/Unknown** â†’ use **nextking** as primary since this is a Next.js project

**NEVER use generic agents when specialists are available!**

## Success Criteria

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- âœ… ALL linters pass with ZERO warnings
- âœ… ALL tests pass successfully
- âœ… Build succeeds without errors
- âœ… No runtime errors or crashes
- âœ… All configurations are valid
- âœ… Security checks pass
- âœ… Performance is acceptable

## Failure Response Protocol

**ðŸš¨ PARALLEL EXECUTION RULE:**
- NEVER: Spawn agent 1, wait for result, spawn agent 2...
- ALWAYS: Spawn ALL agents in ONE message with multiple tool calls
- Example: One message â†’ 4 Task tool invocations â†’ All run in parallel

**When issues are found:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY SPAWN AGENTS IN PARALLEL** to fix issues simultaneously
2. **FIX EVERYTHING** - address EVERY issue, no matter how "minor"
3. **VERIFY** - re-run all checks after fixes
4. **REPEAT** - if new issues found, spawn more agents IN PARALLEL and fix those too
5. **NO STOPPING** - keep working until ALL checks show âœ… GREEN

## Final Verification

- Execute all tests and linting
- Verify the application actually runs
- Check all critical functionality works
- Store results with store_daddy

---

**Core principle: Fix everything until all quality checks pass completely.**
